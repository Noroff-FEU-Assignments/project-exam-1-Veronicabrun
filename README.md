# Blog Site Project

## Goal
To apply the skills learned during the first year of studies by creating a fully functional blog site.

## Brief
The task is to create a blog site with the following required pages:
- Home Page
- About Page
- List of Blog Posts
- Blog Post Specific Pages
- Contact Page

### Home Page
- Features a 'Latest Posts' section designed as a carousel (slider) for desktop.
- Displays four posts at a time with navigational arrows to view more posts.
- The mobile layout can be adjusted as needed without using a carousel.

### Blog Page
- Shows the first 10 blog posts initially.
- Users can click to load more posts, which are displayed below the initial set.

### Blog Specific Page
- Dynamically built using a query string parameter based on the clicked blog link.
- The page title changes based on the selected blog post (e.g., “My Blog | An Article I Wrote”).
- Clicking on images within the blog opens them in a modal for a larger view.
- Clicking outside the modal hides it.

### Contact Page
- Contains four text boxes: Name, Email, Subject, and Message.
- Validation requirements:
  - Name: More than 5 characters.
  - Email: Must be a valid email address.
  - Subject: More than 15 characters.
  - Message: More than 25 characters.
- JavaScript is used for validation with error messages for invalid inputs.

## WordPress Integration
- Content is stored on a WordPress installation used as a Headless CMS.
- The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, fetching data via the WordPress REST API.
- At least 12 blogs are added to the WordPress installation with sensible headings and images.
